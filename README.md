**To-Do App**

Fully functional To-Do application , following a course from udemy for learning purposes in order to 
practice different android architecture components like Navigation Component, ROOM database, LiveData, ViewModel, Data Binding and others...
Practicing how to follow the principle of single activity and multiple fragments in your app, how to use Navigation Component, 
how to work with Safe Args to pass data between fragments, and also create custom made Transition Animations for destinations.

* Option to Update the items previously created.
* Option to Delete an item.
* A search option through database and display the result inside the RecyclerView.

## Notes

This is an important to build app because beside working with different android architecture components,
it also teaches how to build and maintain a database, 
how to write SQL queries to insert, update, delete data from database.
I've also had to practice with Clean Architecture in a project, 
I've learn how to organize a project structure and maintain good code readability.
now I also have an idea how custom animations work and how to implement them in my future projects. 
It's a long way with a lot of information to process through this course. 
Another challenge is finding a replacing for all the old already deprecated techniques which 
is not always an easy task and even some time frustrating.
